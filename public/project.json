    "challenges":[
      "In your Earnify project, handling payments and notifications comes with several challenges.",
      "For payments, integrating a secure and reliable payment gateway like PayPal or Stripe can be complex, requiring proper authentication, API handling, and transaction verification. Fraud prevention is another concern, as users might attempt fake transactions, exploit the system for extra coins, or create bots to manipulate tasks. Ensuring seamless and accurate conversion of coins to real currency and managing withdrawal requests without loopholes is crucial. Scalability also becomes a challenge when handling a high volume of transactions, as the system must remain fast and efficient. Additionally, compliance with financial regulations such as KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti-Money Laundering) is necessary to avoid legal issues while securing user financial data.",
      "For notifications, delivering real-time updates for task status, payments, and other essential activities can be challenging. Implementing WebSockets or push notifications efficiently requires a well-structured system to prevent delays and ensure reliability. Managing a high volume of notifications without overwhelming users or causing server overload is another hurdle. Notifications must also be properly categorized so users receive only relevant alerts, preventing spam and improving engagement. Lastly, ensuring cross-platform compatibility so notifications work seamlessly across mobile and desktop devices is essential for a smooth user experience."
